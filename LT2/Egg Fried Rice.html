    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</li>    
        <li>Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)</li>
        <li>A tin of sweetcorn</li>   
        <li>A few mushrooms</li>   
        <li>1-2 eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.
    </li>
        <li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.</li>
        <li> Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</li>
        <li>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</li>
        <li>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-­‐8 minutes maybe?</li>
